Enjoying business case championships.  
Passionate about data analysis from the first year at university, after completing an introductory course on the topic!  
Interested in machine learning. 

Currently studying ML and data analysis on my own, mostly using [datacamp](https://www.delacamp.com) and [coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

#### Tools 🔧 :

```python
print('My main tool is python 🐍!')
IDE = 'Jupyter Lab'

tasks = ['statistical inference', 'data manipulation', 'data visualization', 'machine learning', 'web scarpping']
```
