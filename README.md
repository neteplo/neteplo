Enjoying business case championships. 

Passionate about data analysis since my first year at university, after taking an introductory course on this topic. Interested in machine learning. I am currently studying these topics on my own, mostly using [data camp] (https://www.delacamp.com) and [coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

#### Tools ðŸ”§ :

```python
print('My main tool is python!')
libraries = ['pandas', 'numpy', 'matplotlib', 'seaborn', 'scikit-learn']
tasks = ['data manipulation', 'web scarpping', 'data visualization', 'machine learning']
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM me
WHERE info = "I also know some SQL"
AND tasks IN ("writing queries", "reporting")
AND dialect = "PostgreSQL";
```
