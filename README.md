Enjoying business case championships.  
Passionate about data analysis since my first year at university, after taking an introductory course on this topic.  
Interested in machine learning. 

Currently studying ML and data analysis on my own, mostly using [datacamp](https://www.delacamp.com) and [coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

#### Tools ðŸ”§ :

```python
print('My main tool is python!')
libraries = ['pandas', 'numpy', 'matplotlib', 'seaborn', 'scikit-learn']
tasks = ['data manipulation', 'web scarpping', 'data visualization', 'machine learning']
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM me
WHERE info = "I also know some SQL"
AND tasks IN ("writing queries", "reporting")
AND dialect = "PostgreSQL";
```
